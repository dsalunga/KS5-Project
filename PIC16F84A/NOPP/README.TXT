NOPPP, the "No-Parts PIC Programmer," is more fully
described in a magazine article (Electronics Now,
September 1998).  Build the circuit shown,
run the program NOPPP.EXE on your PC, and you can program
PIC 16F84, 16C84, and 16F83 microcontrollers.

IMPORTANT NOTE!

The NOPPP programming software has been updated and now
includes a TEST MODE so that you can check your NOPPP circuit
with a voltmeter.  This will help you find wiring errors.
It will also help *me* if you find that NOPPP does not work
with your parallel port -- I'll be able to figure out what's
wrong and suggest appropriate modifications.

Because NOPPP is incompatible with a few of the newest
parallel ports, a modified circuit is being designed and
will be posted on the NOPPP web page when available.


IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONS:

(1) Make sure your 12-volt supply is actually 12.0 volts or
higher.  Some PC power supplies put out as little as 11.7 V.

(2) When running under Windows 3.1, NOPPP must apparently
run full-screen, not in a window.  If you have problems
under Windows 3.1, try running NOPPP under plain DOS.

(3) When running NOPPP under OS/2, hardware timer access
must be enabled.  (It's in the settings for the DOS session.)

NOPPP runs fine under Windows 95.
